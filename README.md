# co-py
co-py is a WIP tool that allows you to copy files from the CLI with access to a buffer thus without having to specify source and destination immediately, unlike the linux cp command.

# usage
After adding to PATH to your liking (a guide will come) you should be able to run cp.py to select the file(s) to copy, and paste.py to paste in the CWD. After this first release, more options will come.
