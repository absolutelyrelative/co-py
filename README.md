# co-py
co-py is a tool that allows you to copy files from the CLI with access to a buffer thus without having to specify source and destination immediately, unlike the linux cp command. It also includes an md5 calculation, which requires Python 3.11 and above.

# usage
After adding to PATH to your liking you should be able to run cp.py to select the file(s) to copy, and paste.py to paste in the CWD.
